# Booberry Theme

An emacs theme emulating the [helix theme](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/runtime/themes/boo_berry.toml)
of the same name. All credit for this theme is owed to the team who developed it.

The theme requires [autothemer](https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer), which can be added via `use-package`:
```elisp
(use-package autothemer
  :ensure t)
```

With autothemer installed, you can clone the repository and place the theme in your emacs directory to use it.
